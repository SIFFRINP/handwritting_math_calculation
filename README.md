## About us
This project combines a graphical interface with an Artificial Intelligence model to recognize and compute handwritten mathematical expressions.

### Main features
- graphical user interface (Pygame).
- Detection of symbol on the interface (Opencv)
- AI model trained to recognize numbers (0-9) and mathematical operators (+, -, *, /).
- Instant resolution of handwritten mathematical expressions.

### Technologies used
- **Python**: main language.
- **Pygame**: graphical user interface.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: for the handwriting recognition AI model.
